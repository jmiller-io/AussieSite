      Bonato Aussies is a small hobby breeder located In Eastern Colorado. Our goals when producing a litter are always to improve the next generation, and to enhance our own breeding program. Our primary goal is to breed companion puppies with outstanding temperaments, our litters are carefully planned to preserve this wonderful breed. All but one of our Aussies are AKC or ASCA registered or dual registered AKC/ASCA. Most of our dogs are OFA , CERF cleared (hips and eyes.) Detailed information regarding particular dogs can be found on the males and females tabs.

We breed for an Australian Shepherd that is sound in mind and body with outstanding, health, temperament and Intelligence. All our puppies are handled daily, so they are very socialized by the time they go to their new homes. None of our dogs including our puppies are kept in a kennels except at night. They are all raised in an open environment as part of our family, which we feel is very important part of their socialization process. We give full guarantees on any genetic issues for 26 months.

All dogs and puppies are sold on a spay/neuter contract. Full registration for show/breeding is on VERY limited basis, to experienced and approved homes only. All buyers must complete a questionnaire. We always maintain first right of refusal on all our dogs.  Puppies come with AKC/ASCA papers, toys, pictures of parents and pups since birth. They are current on vaccinations, worming and health check. We feed a premium diet and put a lot of thought, care and passion into everything we do with our dogs. Prices are $1000 to $1800 for most pups depending on type and eye color. Shipping may be available for $350 extra. Once you decide that you want one of our puppies, and we feel that you would be a good match, we will send you a reservation request to fill out and mail back with a $500.00 non-refundable deposit to reserve a puppy, at that time you will be put on the waiting list. There is a $500.00 non-refundable deposit on all pups and dogs purchased from us. Puppy buyers are invited and encouraged to visit us and meet the parents and their relatives by appointment only.
